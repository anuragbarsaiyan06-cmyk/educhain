# Educhain

## Project Title
Educhain – On‑Chain Course Completion Tracker

## Project Description
Educhain is a simple Solidity smart contract that allows teachers to create courses and issue verifiable completion records to students on a blockchain. Each completion is stored on‑chain so that anyone can later verify that a given address has finished a particular course.

## Project Vision
The vision of Educhain is to become a minimal building block for decentralized education systems, where learning achievements are transparent, tamper‑resistant, and not locked inside any single institution. It aims to replace fragile, paper‑based certificates with programmable, interoperable, and verifiable credentials.

## Key Features
- **Course Creation:** Any address can act as a teacher and create new courses with a title and description.
- **Teacher‑Controlled Status:** Course creators can activate or deactivate their courses when needed.
- **On‑Chain Completions:** Teachers can mark students as having completed a specific course, storing timestamped records on‑chain.
- **Student History Queries:** Anyone can query how many courses a student has completed and inspect each completion record.
- **Event‑Driven Design:** Events are emitted for course creation, status updates, and completions, making indexing and frontend integrations easy.

## Future Scope
- **Role Management:** Add explicit roles for institutes, reviewers, or accrediting bodies with granular permissions.
- **Reputation Layer:** Build a reputation score for students and teachers based on completed or created courses.
- **Metadata & IPFS:** Store detailed course content and certificates on IPFS and link the hashes from the contract.
- **Token Incentives:** Introduce ERC‑20 or ERC‑721 rewards for course completion or high‑performing students.
- **Multi‑Chain Deployments:** Deploy Educhain across multiple EVM chains and add support for cross‑chain verification of achievements.
